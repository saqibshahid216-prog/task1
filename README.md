---Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset
-Objective

The purpose of this project is to explore a simple dataset, understand its structure, summarize the data, and visualize relationships and distributions of features.

--Dataset

Name: Iris Dataset

Source: Available via seaborn or other open sources.

Description: Contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a species label (setosa, versicolor, virginica).

---Instructions / Workflow

Load the dataset

Use pandas to read the dataset into a DataFrame.

Inspect the dataset

Display shape, column names, and the first few rows using .shape, .columns, and .head().

Summarize statistical properties with .describe().

---Visualize the dataset

Scatter plot: Analyze relationships between petal length and petal width, color-coded by species.

Histogram: Examine the distribution of sepal length.

Box plot: Detect outliers and observe the spread of sepal length for each species.

Libraries used

pandas for data loading and inspection.

matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.

----Skills Demonstrated

Loading and inspecting data with pandas.

Summarizing data with descriptive statistics.

Visualizing data using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.

---Outcome

Clear understanding of the Iris dataset structure.

Visual insights into feature relationships, distributions, and potential outliers.
